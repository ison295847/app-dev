Glorb's ***"Bikini Bottom"*** Series are a collection of songs in which all have a continuing story. It uses the well known world of *"Spongebob Squarepants"* as the universe in which the story progresses on, also using their characters, such as *Spongebob Squarepants, Patrick Star, . It is not for the faint of heart, as the songs are of the *Drill music* genre, a genre of *hip hop music* which are noted for their **explicit, confrontational style of lyricism and association with crime.**
